## Introduction

Sarcasm detection in news headlines is a challenging natural language processing (NLP) task. This project explores two different machine learning models to address this problem: RoBERTa, a transformer-based model, and CNN, a Convolutional Neural Network.

## Project Structure

- `RoBERTa_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the RoBERTa approach.
- `CNN_Model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the CNN approach.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and evaluation.
