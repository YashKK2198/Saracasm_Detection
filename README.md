## Introduction

Sarcasm detection in news headlines is a challenging natural language processing (NLP) task. This project explores two different machine learning models to address this problem: RoBERTa, a transformer-based model, and CNN, a Convolutional Neural Network.

## Project Structure

- `News_Headlines_Sarcasm_Detection`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the RoBERTa and CNN approach.
- `News_Headlines_Sarcasm_Detection.pdf`: PDF file for evaluation the code and results.
- `README.md`: This README file.
